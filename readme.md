# A*: An Introduction to Pathfinding

## Intro

This is a quick introduction to Dijkstra's algorithm and to the A-Star search algorithm.

It lets you look at how the algorithms work, as you construct them.

## Set Up

1. Git clone this repo and cd into it.
2. "npm install"
3. If you haven't globally installed "webpack" and "webpack-dev-server" then "npm install -g webpack" and "npm install -g webpack-dev-server".
4. If you haven't globally installed "mocha" then "npm install -g mocha".
5. There's only one file which you'll be editing, which is "pathfinders.js." IMPORTANT: Before starting to edit it, finish reading these instructions.
6. You may find looking at graph.js and graph_specs.js useful.  Looking at anything else is extremely unlikely to be useful.
7. To test your changes to "pathfinders.ks", "npm test"
8. To look at how your algorithm does on a 2d map, "npm start" and go to localhost:8080.
